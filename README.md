# Udacity-CloudDevOps

Udacity Cloud Dev Ops aims to provide hands-on experience on AWS usage (S3 buckets, databases, Load balancing, CDN, etc.). This repository holds my personal assets I created in the 5 Lessons of the udacity course. 
Feel free to clone and use for your own lessons respectively.
